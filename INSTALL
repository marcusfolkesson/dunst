The following dependencies are needed:

    dbus
    libxinerama
    libxft
    libxss
    libxdg-basedir
    glib
    pango/cairo

On Debian and Debian-based distros you'll probably also need the *-dev packages.

With all dependencies present you can build dunst with:

    $ mkdir build
	$ cmake ../
	$ make

and install with:

    $ sudo make install
